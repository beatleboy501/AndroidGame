    Jump the peg is a game I created as part of an edX course called "Jugando con Android" - literally "Playing with Android"     in Spanish - offered by the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid.
    The target version is Android SDK 15.

    It's a simple game played with virtual pegs and holes on your screen.
    You jump over one peg on the board using another peg that will fill an empty hole on the other side.

    If you just want to download the APK file (the only file you need to run the game on your android device) you can find it     in AndroidGame/bin.

    The least number of pegs I've gotten down to is 4; can you beat my number?
